## Key Questions
- Do higher-rated schools correlate with higher house prices?
- Which boroughs show the strongest relationships?

## Results (Short Summary)
•	Findings indicate that boroughs with a higher proportion of Outstanding or Good state schools tend to exhibit higher average house prices, though the relationship is not uniform across all areas. 
•	Analysis showed that Camden has over 55% Outstanding-rated state primary schools and some of the highest average property values (approximately £860,000). Richmond upon Thames similarly has around 45% Outstanding schools with high property prices (approximately £813,000). Newham, despite having about 50% Outstanding schools, has significantly lower average house prices (approximately £427,000), indicating that additional factors influence local property markets. Kensington & Chelsea has around 50% Outstanding state secondary schools alongside the highest property values (approximately £1.4 million), further suggesting that school quality is only one of several determinants of house prices.
