## Contents
- Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- CSV datasets
- Tableau visualizations

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau
- Excel/CSV

## Key Questions
- Do higher-rated schools correlate with higher house prices?
- Which boroughs show the strongest relationships?

## Results (Short Summary)
- Findings indicate that boroughs with a higher proportion of Outstanding or Good state schools tend to exhibit higher average house prices, though the relationship is not uniform across all areas.
- Boroughs such as Camden and Richmond upon Thames demonstrate both strong school performance and elevated property values, whereas areas like Newham reveal that other socioeconomic factors also influence affordability and demand.
- Overall, the analysis highlights that educational quality contributes to the spatial inequality of property values within London, reinforcing the notion of a “school quality premium.”
